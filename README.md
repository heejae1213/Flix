### Notes
Regarding Pod Installation, as my macOS is Catalina, I followed the [Catalina-specific Pod installation guide](https://hackmd.io/@anandsaimishra/S1UY3W7HP), but it didn't work for me. <br>
Instead, just following the [General Pod installation guide](https://guides.codepath.org/ios/CocoaPods#installing-cocoapods) from CodePath worked for me. <br>
Below is my environment details.

```
macOS Catalina  10.15.6
Xcode 12
```
